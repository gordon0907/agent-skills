description: Use for general Python coding tasks, such as writing, fixing, and refactoring.

1. Use the latest stable Python version (currently 3.14) and the latest stable versions of libraries involved.
2. Always use MCP tool "context7" to confirm current documentation for any Python or library APIs you use.
3. Be proactive about using new, stable Python features when they improve clarity or maintainability.
4. If the user asks you to modify something specific, do not change unrelated code or comments. Keep changes minimal, but update any directly related comments/docstrings when needed.
5. Write or refactor code following the style rules in references/python_style.md.
