description: Use for general Python coding tasks, such as writing, fixing, and refactoring.
---

1. Use the latest stable Python version (currently 3.14) and the latest stable versions of libraries involved. If you need to confirm the latest Python or library API details, use MCP tool "context7" to check the current documentation.
2. If the user asks you to modify something specific, do not change unrelated code or comments. Keep changes minimal, but update any directly related comments/docstrings when needed.
3. Write or refactor code following the style rules in references/python_style.md.
